# LOAN-ELIGIBILITY-PREDICTION-USING-AI-ML
The goal of this project is to develop a system using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to predict whether a person is eligible for a loan or not. The system will automate the loan approval process, improving decision-making efficiency, accuracy, and reducing manual intervention.
